Witness Name: Shyam Thapa
Relation to case: Neighbor of Complainant

I, Shyam Thapa, being duly sworn, hereby declare under oath that the following facts are true to the best of my knowledge and belief:

1. I am a resident of Thamel, Kathmandu, and my house is adjacent to the property of Ram Bahadur.
2. On the evening of 2024-03-11, around 7:30 PM, I clearly heard loud shouting coming from outside.
3. I looked out my window and saw Hari Prasad Koirala shouting at Ram Bahadur near the front gate of Ram Bahadur's house.
4. Shortly after the argument escalated, I saw Hari Prasad kick the metal gate forcefully, which caused it to collapse inwards.
5. Hari Prasad then walked away quickly down the street.

I am willing to testify to these facts in a court of law if required.
